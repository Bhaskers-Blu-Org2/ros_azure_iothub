# Azure IoT Hub Relay for ROS (roscpp version)

# Deployment
This node can be run using `roslaunch` (replacing the value for `connection_string` with the value given by Azure IoT Hub):
```
roslaunch roscpp_azure_iothub sample.launch connection_string:="HostName=sample.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=rosbot;SharedAccessKey=sampleKey"
```

This value can also be set in the ROS Parameter Server at `/roscpp_azure_iothub_node/connection_string`.
